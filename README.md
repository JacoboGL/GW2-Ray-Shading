# ***Welcome!***

This is my take on enhancing the visual experience of Guild Wars 2. It is a game that in it's original form have breathtaking views and zones, for someone who have not tried custom shaders on games the original experience could be enough, but once you try my shading preset, you won't come back.
I have tested and refined it, and you won't notice any FPS drop if your system is decent enough for the game to run.

***For installation, please read carefully and follow the guide, it won't take you more than 5 minutes to set everything up.***

### üìå [ Ray Shading preset](https://github.com/JacoboGL/GW2-Ray-Shading/releases/download/release/RayShading-1.0.zip) 
>Extract the .ini file and place it in your game folder (C:/Program Files/Guild Wars 2)


## Installing Ray Shading preset with ReShade

‚ùáÔ∏è Open the ***ReShade Setup*** file

A warning about multiplayer games will popup. Currently, Guild Wars 2 can be integrated with the ReShade engine and **WON'T GET YOU BANNED**, so don't worry about it.

Then it'll show you a window like this:

![ReShade first screen](https://i.imgur.com/kBrOUnP.png)

Click the "Browse..." button and search your ***Gw2-64.exe*** file.

Usually in:
```
C:/Program Files/Guild Wars 2
```

You can also Right Click your Guild Wars 2 shortcut on the desktop, and select "Open file location", copy the location and navigate to that folder in the ReShade window.

Once picked, click ***"Next"***

‚ùáÔ∏è On the next window it'll give you four options for the rendering API of the game. You should pick ***DirectX 10/11/11*** and click ***Next***

![ReShade API select](https://i.imgur.com/rrBgl9K.png)

‚ùáÔ∏è Next step is to browse for the ***Ray Shading*** preset (.ini) and open it.

>I recommend placing the file on the game folder, browse for it and forget about it once the route is selected. 
>
>‚ö†Ô∏èIf you have it in your Downloads folder and delete it after installation, ReShade won't be able to load the shading effects!

Click ***Next***

‚ùáÔ∏è In the following window, it'll show you the effect packages that are detected from the preset, I recommend leaving everything as default and just click ***Next***.

The download for the necessary files will start and shouldn't take more than a minute.

If everything went accordingly, you should see that ReShade is now installed!

‚ùáÔ∏è Now start Guild Wars 2 and you should see the shader is already activated, also a ReShade window on top saying it is installed and you should press ***Home*** in your keyboard in order to access the menu.

Click on 'Skip Tutorial' and then ***Home*** again to hide the window.

‚ö†Ô∏è You can go to the settings tab in the ReShade menu and select a shortcut for toggling the shading anytime, I use ***CTRL + Home*** as it's easy to remember.

### Aaand... We're done!
Enjoy the beauty of Guild Wars reimagined.
